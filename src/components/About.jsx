      <p>
        I’m Charith Kandula, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of South Dakota with a deep focus on generative AI, 3D web development, and full-stack application design. I thrive at the intersection of AI and interactivity — building tools that make complex technology intuitive, engaging, and impactful.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Generative AI Intern at Lid Vizion, I developed intelligent systems that convert text and images into 3D models using tools like <strong>Meshy</strong>, <strong>TriposR</strong>, and <strong>Dreamfusion</strong>. I also engineered a 3D interactive educational concept game aligned with the Zero Hunger initiative, integrating AI pipelines into real-time rendering environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical stack includes <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Three.js</strong>, <strong>@react-three/fiber</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> on the front end, and <strong>PyTorch</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, <strong>OpenAI API</strong>, and <strong>Hugging Face Diffusers</strong> for AI/ML. I have also built custom tools like a Stable Diffusion notebook for text-to-image generation and a 3D viewer with model format conversion capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        With experience as a Graduate Research Assistant, I’ve also explored data pipelines, automated content generation, and responsive web systems — always prioritizing clean architecture and user-centered design. I’m passionate about making AI visually explorable and practically useful in everyday applications.
